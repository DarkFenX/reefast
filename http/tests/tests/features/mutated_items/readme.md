Stages are just a short description of how much data was available for the mutation:

- stage 1: mutator is not available;
- stage 2: mutator is available, but mutated item ID cannot be found for the base item ID;
- stage 3: mutator is available, mutated item ID is located for the base item ID, but mutated item itself is not available;
- stage 4: all the data was available.
